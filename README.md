**Project 7: End-to-End Data Science Project** 

**Project Title:** Mall Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning  

**Overview:**  
This end-to-end data science project involves performing the complete data science workflow on a selected topic—customer segmentation—using the *Mall Customer Segmentation* dataset. The project covers all critical phases: from data understanding and cleaning to model training, evaluation, and saving results. The entire process is documented and analyzed to derive actionable business insights.

**Steps Involved:**  
1. Dataset Exploration  
2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Engineering  
5. Model Selection & Training (K-Means Clustering)  
6. Model Evaluation  
7. Exporting the final clustered dataset as a CSV file  

**Key Insights and Conclusions:**  
1. **Female Dominance:** Most clusters are predominantly female, suggesting that marketing strategies may benefit from a gender-focused approach.  
2. **High-Value Segment (Cluster 1):** Young, high-income, and high-spending customers represent an ideal audience for premium and luxury products.  
3. **Contrasting Behaviors:**  
   - *Cluster 3:* High earners with low spending habits—indicative of a conservative or savings-oriented group.  
   - *Cluster 2:* Low-income individuals with high spending patterns—potentially driven by aspirational lifestyles or social influences.  
4. **Budget-Conscious Group (Cluster 4):** Older customers with lower income and spending, likely to respond well to discounts and loyalty incentives.  
5. **Balanced Consumers (Cluster 0):** Middle-aged individuals with average income and spending—ideal for stable, value-driven products and services.
